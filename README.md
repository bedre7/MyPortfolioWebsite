2.	My CV

o	In this section of my webpage the content will look something like this…

o	For the time being, A slider seems the best option to do this section which includes the above contents along with some zoom in effects upon mouse hover.
o	Some animation effects will be included here as well.

3.	Our heritages

For the most part, images will play a great role here, to create enough white        space a brief description will be written alongside the images of the heritages.


4.	Log in

Here, a login page will be displayed allowing the user to login with his/her email address and password.


5.	My interests

In this section, I will include…
o	My hobbies and leisure time activities will be listed along with expressive icons and images. 
o	My favorite sports list will also be part of this page. 


6.	Contact

Finally, a form will be displayed that is more like a survey, a series of questions will be asked and will be submitted to another page to display the user’s input(answer)

        
      This is a brief overview of what I think I will be able to do in the next few weeks, of course there will be an update and changes, but for now this is how it will look like in a nutshell.
